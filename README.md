## Screenshots taking from the app:

### Capture from camera

To use this feature, click on the 'Capture from Camera' menu option available under "File Capture from Camera" --> "File Capture from Camera".

A pop-up window will then appear, displaying the video image being captured from the camera connected to the computer. The video playback has a default speed of 30 frames per second. Finally, when the user presses a key on the keyboard, a capture of the frame being played back on the computer will be made.

This feature allows copying the selected region of interest (ROI) to a new image. If the original image does not have a ROI selected, this option will copy the entire image.
